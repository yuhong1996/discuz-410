# Discuz! 4.1.0 (Community-Maintained Fork)

Discuz! is a classic BBS/forum system originally developed by Comsenz Inc. (2001-2006).  
This repository is a community-maintained fork under the MIT license, updated for modern PHP environments.

## Current Fork Status

- **PHP 8.4+ compatibility upgrade completed** (see `php84-upgrade-report.md`)
- Major PHP8 warning/error-prone legacy paths have been hardened
- Runtime compatibility warning filter added in `include/common.inc.php` (targeted legacy warning prefixes only)
- Deprecated external integrations are force-disabled by default:
  - Passport
  - E-commerce (Alipay / Orders / ShopEx)
  - AvatarShow
- Matching admin actions are blocked in `admincp.php` and related menu entries are hidden

## Features Currently Available

- Forum core: categories, forums, sub-forums, threads, replies, polls
- User core: registration, login, user groups, permissions, credits, profile, avatar
- Content: BBCode, attachments, smilies, moderation tooling
- Communication: PM, announcements, mail notifications
- Admin control panel: `admincp.php` (forums, users, groups, templates, plugins, DB, logs)
- Plugin mechanism: hook-based `plugins/`
- Multi-interface: `wap/`, `archiver/`
- Language packs: Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, English

## Features Disabled by Default

To reduce dependency and legacy integration risk, this fork disables:

- Passport / SiteEngine / ShopEx
- Alipay / Orders
- AvatarShow

Notes:
- Frontend entry points are removed or conditionally hidden
- Admin entry points are blocked
- Runtime switches are force-disabled in `include/common.inc.php`

## Requirements

- Recommended: **PHP 8.4+**
- Database: MySQL 4.1+ or PostgreSQL
- Web server: Apache / Nginx

Note: Older versions (such as PHP 7.4) may still run, but primary validation in this fork is done against PHP 8.4.

## Installation

1. Import database schema
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p your_database < install/discuz.sql
   ```

2. Configure `config.inc.php`
   ```php
   $dbhost = '127.0.0.1';
   $dbuser = 'your_user';
   $dbpw   = 'your_password';
   $dbname = 'your_database';
   $tablepre = 'cdb_';
   ```

3. Set writable permissions
   ```bash
   chmod -R 777 attachments/ forumdata/
   ```

4. Open `install/` in browser for initial setup

5. Open `admincp.php` for administration

```

## Maintenance Notes

- Each entry script defines `CURSCRIPT` then includes `include/common.inc.php`
- Keep access guard lines: `if(!defined('IN_DISCUZ')) exit('Access Denied');`
- Do not edit `forumdata/cache/` or `forumdata/templates/` directly (generated files)
- Edit templates in `templates/default/*.htm`
- If template updates do not show up, enable `$tplrefresh = 1` or clear `forumdata/templates/`
- Footer displays the real runtime PHP version and links to the matching official PHP release branch page

## PHP 8.4 Upgrade Summary

- `mysql_*` replaced with `mysqli_*`
- `preg_replace /e` replaced with `preg_replace_callback`
- Added many null/type guards for stricter PHP8 behavior
- Added `EXTR_SKIP` to risky `extract()` calls
- Fixed short-tag/string interpolation incompatibilities under PHP8
